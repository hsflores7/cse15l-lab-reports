## Snipet 3
Expected: 

![exp snip 3](report4-snips/Screenshot%202022-05-21%20143254.png)

There is 3 links: `this title text is really long and takes up more than one line and has some line breaks`, `https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-15l-spring-2022/schedu`
(this one doesn't use the markdown formatting it's just a link), `this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis for a while`
